# Cross-Language Vulnerability Detection Benchmark

This repository contains the benchmark materials used for evaluating cross-language vulnerability detection with a focus on CWE-614 (Secure Cookie Flag). Our work involves translating insecure Java test cases from the OWASP Benchmark into Python using iterative prompt refinement with GPT-4o. Additionally, the repository includes several scripts designed to isolate and organize the necessary files for the benchmark.
